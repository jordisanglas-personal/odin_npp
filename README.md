# Syntax highlighting in Odin for Notepad++
This file defines the Odin programming language as a User Defined Language (UDL) for Notepad++, which allows for syntax highlighting. It is incomplete (e.g., it does not highlight directives such as #packed), but I did not find any other UDL file for Odin, so I decided to create a simple one. _Note: I know very little about creating UDL files._

Many of the colors are based in the color scheme found in [https://github.com/tgschultz/Npp-ziglang-UDL](https://github.com/tgschultz/Npp-ziglang-UDL), for Zig.

## How to use it
1. Download the Odin.xml file.
2. Open Notepad++ and go to Language > User Defined Language > Define your Language.
3. Click on "Import" and choose the Odin.xml file.
